// JavaScript Event Loop, Call Stack, and Task Queue Example

console.log("Start"); // 1

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout 1"); // 5
}, 0);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout 2"); // 6
}, 0);

const fetchData = () => {
    console.log("Fetching data..."); // 2
    // Simulating a delay with a timeout
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data received!"); // 4
    }, 1000);
};

fetchData(); // 2

console.log("End"); // 3

Explanation of the Code
Synchronous Code Execution:

The first line console.log("Start") is executed and logged (1).
The first setTimeout is called, scheduling "Timeout 1" to run after 0 milliseconds but it doesnâ€™t execute yet. Instead, it gets placed in the task queue.
The second setTimeout is also called, scheduling "Timeout 2" to run after 0 milliseconds, which also goes into the task queue.
Function Call:

The fetchData function is invoked. It logs "Fetching data..." (2) to the console.
Inside fetchData, another setTimeout is set to log "Data received!" after 1 second, which also goes into the task queue.
End of Synchronous Code:

After the function completes, console.log("End") is executed, logging "End" (3).
The Event Loop in Action
Now that the synchronous code has completed, the call stack is empty. The event loop starts processing the task queue:

The first task is to execute "Timeout 1" (5), which logs to the console.
The next task is "Timeout 2" (6), which logs to the console.
Finally, after 1 second, the task for "Data received!" executes (4) when its timeout completes.

###
The output of the code will be:



Start
Fetching data...
End
Timeout 1
Timeout 2
Data received!

###
Summary
The event loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the execution of other code.
The call stack is where functions are executed in LIFO order.
The task queue holds asynchronous callbacks, which are executed only when the call stack is empty.
